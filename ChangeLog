    * Implemented iterator for class `EMList'.
    * Added iterator benchmark for external memory lists.

      used within GDB's Python.

    * Replaced whitespace with tabs in makefiles.

    * Implemented `in' and `del' operators for external memory dictionaries.
    * Method `open()' in classes `EMDict' and `EMList' was erroneously marked
      as `M_NOARGS'.

      in "mapped_file.c".
    * Added sanity checks in "marshaller.c" (see relative comment).
