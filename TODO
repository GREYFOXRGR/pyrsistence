    * Add support for compression and encryption.
    * Optimize datastructures (compaction, removal of unused entries etc).
    * Use locking for concurrency?
    * Change **EMDict** hashing function; linear probing will probably perform
      better.
    * Replace red-black tree with per-size free-lists a-la TCMalloc.
    * Replace `mapped_file_get_eof()' with `mapped_file_seek(..., 0, SEEK_END)'?
    * Hybrid main/external memory model?
